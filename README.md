# README

This repository contains several baseline templates for the AI Driving Olympics. The templates are aimed to have roughly the same workflow and ease of process from installation to submission.

You may find

- a reinforcement learning template for the lane following task in the folder AIDO_LF_RL_template
- an imitation learning template for the lane following task in the folder AIDO_LF_IM_template


Further instructions may be found in the READMEs of the individual folders.
